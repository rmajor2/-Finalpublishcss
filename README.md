# Final Project Website

This project is a simple two-page website consisting of a homepage and a contact page. It uses clean, semantic HTML along with CSS for styling. The design is responsive and includes some custom graphics to enhance the visual appeal.

## Project Structure

- **index.html** — The main landing page with an overview and featured content.
- **contact.html** — A contact form page where visitors can get in touch.
- **styles.css** — Stylesheet defining the look and feel of the site.
- **images/** — Folder containing various images and icons used throughout the site.
- **-Finalpublishcss/** — This folder contains a Git repository related to CSS publishing tools (not directly part of the site).

## Features

- Simple and clean layout focused on usability.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Custom SVG images and icons for a modern look.
- Organized and readable code structure for easy maintenance.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate to `contact.html` from the homepage or open it directly.

## Notes

- The project is built with only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript or backend code.
- Images are stored locally inside the `images/` directory.
- The `-Finalpublishcss/` folder is a separate Git repo used for managing CSS and can be ignored if you only want the website files.
